The getting started section of the RabbitMQ website is actually very good, it explains the concepts in a very easy to understand format. The only downside for me(being a .net coder) was the lack of .net code in the examples, I thought it would be probably added at a later date but I just checked back and it still doesn't(as of now) exist. This is the DotNet version of these examples. Walkthrough of all these examples are available on my blog http://simonwdixon.wordpress.com. Original examples are here http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html
